# Control analysis of SWSTD-FCD correlation for low global signal variance subjects
* `input` this folder contains the data to perform the estimation process of pMFM. Files in this folder are used by the scripts in `scripts` folder.
* `scripts` this folder contains the scripts to generate the control analysis results of the paper. 
    * `CBIG_pMFM_STDFCD_lowGS.m` this is the function compute the SWSTD-FCD correlation for low global signal variance subject
    
# Usage
* Go to working directory using command: `cd $CBIG_CODE_DIR/stable_projects/fMRI_dynamics/Kong2021_pMFM/part2_pMFM_control_analysis/SWSTD_FCD_lowGS/scripts` and follow the step order to run the scripts.
* For Matlab scripts, you can run it directly in terminal.
